They are often one of the main performances of their associated events and many times direct the attention of the audience to other performances as the night goes on.

These fighters are often power-hungry individuals, who have forfeit their souls in exchange for demonic abilities. Some do so to accomplish some mundane goal, believing that these profane powers will allow them to conquer glory or gold; others, however, do it for a more nefarious reason, expecting to fight in the blood war as generals, reincarnated as a balor after their deaths."

While they are not averse to combat, they often seek avenues of persuasion and diplomacy when circumstances permit. In lieu of conventional weaponry, they sculpt their very bodies into instruments of their goddess's will.
